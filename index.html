							<h6>Introduction: Intention and Preparation</h6>
						</div>
						<p>Hajj is the fifth pillar of Islam and it is one of the biggest investments that a Muslim is
							required to perform at least once in his/her lifetime. This specific type of worship
							involves
							physical, financial, spiritual, and social sacrifices. Therefore, it is extremely important
							to
							prepare yourself for it. Make sure you take it seriously and you obtain the proper
							understanding
							of Hajj to adopt the right mindset. Considering these points, let us pave your path to this
							journey by contemplating and reflecting on a few fundamental verses by our creator and the
							teaching of our beloved prophet Muhammad ( peace and blessings be upon him).</p>

						<p>From the manners and etiquette of Hajj and Umrah that was mentioned by Allah in the Quran,
							following the completion of the house of Allah by Prophet Ibrahim and his son Ismail (peace
							be
							upon them), they supplicated to Allah the following: "Our Lord and make us Muslims sin
							submission to you and from our descendants a Muslim nation [in submission] to You. And show
							us
							our rites [all the ceremonies of pilgrimage - Haji and Umrah] and accept our repentance.
							Indeed,

							for
							Him.</p>
						<p>"And Complete the Hajj and Umrah for Allah...." (2:197}</p>
						<p>Hajj is not only considered as the fifth pillar of Islam, but as a mandatory religious duty
							for
							Muslims (under certain conditions) and a right by Allah, as in chapter 2:96-97, Allah stated
							that it's a duty we owe to Him as He said:</p>

								did
								not visit My House, he is Mahroum (deprived)" (ibn Hidan and Musnad Abu Yala' 3703,

							<p class="mt-4">Our respected pilgrims: You must perform the rituals of Hajj for the
								glorification, admiration, devotion, and submission to Allah (The Most Glorified, the
								Most
								High). So, you perform them in a state of calmness and tranquility and by following the
								example of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his family).
								Furthermore,
								all that must occupy your thoughts are the remembrance of Allah, Takbeer, praising of
								Allah,
								thanking of Allah, and asking Him for forgiveness. Keep in mind that you are in a state
								of
								worship from the moment you make the intention of wearing your ihram to the moment you
								successfully complete the required rituals.</p>

							<p>Remember dear chosen pilgrim, that Hajj is not a casual stroll where you may play and
								have
								fun with no restrain, as you may see some people during Hajj or Umrah. There is always
								company that may distract you from the remembrance of Allah and pull you towards the
								disobedience against Him. And you may see some people playing excessively, laughing, and
								mocking the manners and forbidden actions, as though Hajj was ordered by Allah for the
								sake
								of having fun and playing.</p>

							<p>There are three types of Hajj as follows:</p>
							<h6>HAJJ AL-TAMATT'U</h6>
							<ul class="mt-4 ml-5">
								<li>Tamattu – linguistically means enjoyment. In this context, it means entering the

									of Ihraam and then to exit from it after the completion of Umrah. This means freeing
									yourself from the restrictions of ihraam for some time until the 8th of Dul-Hajjah
									and
									then to enter it again for the purpose of Hajj.</li>
								<li class="mt-1"> It means to perform Umrah during the months of Hajj (months of Hajj
									are
									Shawwaal, Dhu'l-Qi'dah and Dhu'lHijjah). The pilgrim enters the state of Ihraam for
									Umrah. Once Umrah is completed, the pilgrim then exits the state of ihram.</li>
								<li class="mt-1">The pilgrim enters the state of ihram by saying "Labayka Umratan" "O
									Allah!
									| answer Your call to perform Umrah". Then the pilgrim proceeds to Makkah and
									performs
									Tawaf, Sa'aee, shaves or cuts their hair and by doing that the pilgrim will exit the

							<h6>What is the best type of Hajj?</h6>
							<p class="mt-4">The best of these three types of Hajj is Hajj Al-Tamattu'. This is what the
								Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded upon his companions and
								urged
								them to do. Even if a person enters ihraam for Al-Qiraan or Al-Ifraad, then it is
								strongly
								recommended for him to change his intention to Umrah, then complete his/her Umrah and
								exit
								ihraam, so that he will then be doing Tamattu'. He may do that after doing Tawaaf
								Al-Qudoom
								and Sa'ee – because when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
								preformed
								Tawaaf and Sa'ee during his Farewell Pilgrimage, and his companions were with him, he
								told
								everyone who did not have a sacrificial animal (hady) to change his intention and make
								his
								ihraam for 'Umrah and to cut his hair and exit state of ihraam, and he said, (Were it
								not
								that I have brought the hady with me, I would do what I have commanded you to do).</p>

							<h6>Significance of Ihram</h6>
							<p class="mt-5">A- Ihram is a state of purity, both in mind and body. It is foremost a state
								of
								mind, whereby a spiritual relationship with Allah Almighty is established and the
								vanities
								of the world are renounced. Hajj is an egalitarian rite in the sense that all of
								humanity,
								irrespective of gender, group, ethnic origin, class, rank, or wealth, is equal before
								Allah
								Almighty.The ihram attire, two pieces of white, unstitched cloth, removes all semblance
								of
								social, cultural, and political differences for the sake of equality before Allah
								Almighty.
							</p>
							<p>B- Ihram is one of the prerequisites of Umrah or Hajj. The first step for any pilgrim
								intending to perform Umrah or Hajj is to enter a state of Ihram; at specific entry
								points on
								the way to Makkah. This is known as a spatial Miqat and is the place where one enters
								the
								"state" of Ihram.</p>

							<p>While Makkah remains tens of kilometers away, entering the state of Ihram marks the start
								of
								the rituals. It is analogous to making "Takbeerat al-Ihram" for prayers. This time is
								best
								utilized by making "Dhikr" of Allah and chanting the Talbiyah.</p>

							<p class="mt-4">C- Men must wear a distinctive outfit consisting of two pieces of white,
								unsown,
								cloth. One of the pieces is wrapped around his midriff to cover his lower body, while
								the
								other is draped around his shoulders to cover his upper body. It is recommended to wear
								white cloths but other colours are permissible. It was narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawood,
								and
								Tirmidhi, and authenticated by Al-Albani and Shaaib AlArna ut, on the authority of Ibn
								Abbas
								(may Allah be pleased with him) - he said: "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
								and
								grant him peace, said: Wear from Your white garments because they are the best of your
								garments, and in them are buried your dead."</p>

							<p>Imam Jalaalu Edin al-Suyooti said:</p>
							<p class="mt-1">Regarding acts of Worship that are composed of numerous actions, it is
								sufficient to make the intention at the beginning, and there is no need for a new
								intention
								for each action, because the preliminary intention includes all of that. This applies to
								acts of ritual such as wudoo' and prayer, and al-so Hajj and Umrah. There is no need to
								form
								a specific intention for tawaf, sa'i, Halq and standing (in Arafah), according to the
								more
								correct opinion.</p>
							<p class="mt-1">Shaykh Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shinqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
							</p>
							<p class="mt-1">It should be understood that the scholarly view that is most likely to be
								correct, insha Allah, is that tawaf does not need a specific intention, be-cause the
								intention to perform Hajj is sufficient and includes it. This ap-plies to all the ritual
								of
								Haji, such as standing in 'Arafah, staying overnight in Muzdalifah, sa'i and stoning the
								Jamaraat. None of these actions re-quires a specific intention, because the intention to
								perform Hajj includes all of them. This is the view of most of the scholars,</p>

							<p>and the evidence for that is clear, because the intention to perform an act of worship
								includes all of its parts. Just as there is no need for a specific intention for every
								bow
								and prostration in the prayer, because the intention to pray includes all of that, by
								the
								same token there is no need for a specific intention for each of the actions of Hajj,
								because the intention to perform Hajj includes all of them.</p>
							<p class="mt-1">One of the things that the scholars quoted as evidence for that is the fact
								that
								if a person were to stand in 'Arafah without realising where he is, it would still be
								valid,
								according to scholarly consensus. This was stated by an-Nawawi. In addition to the view
								that
								is correct, in sha Allah, there are two other scholarly views:</p>
							<p class="mt-1">The first is the view of Abu 'Ali ibn Abi Hurayrah, who was a Shaafa'i; this
								view states that specific actions such as tawaf, sa'i and stoning the jamaraat require a
								specific intention (niyyah), and matters that do not re-quire a specific action, and
								simply
								involve staying in a place, such as standing in 'Arafah and staying overnight in
								Muzdalifah,
								do not require a specific intention.</p>

								to

						<h5>1. Tawaaf around the Kabah</h6>
							<p class="my-4">Meaning & Excellence of Tawaf</p>
							<p>Meaning of Tawaf: Linguistically, the word is drawn from the Arabic verb Taafa (Arabic:)
								which means "to walk around" or "to encircle something". One complete circuit of the
								Kaaba
								is known as a Shawt (Arabic:)</p>
							<p class="mt-2">Tawaf is walking around Kaaba seven times in a counterclockwise direction -
								in
								an explicit manner - during Umrah, Hajj or greeting Masjid al-Haram (instead of the
								standard
								2 rakats upon entering a masjid according to the Sunnah). Ibn Kathir (may Allah have
								mercy
								on him) wrote this about al-Bayt al-Ma'mur in his Tafsir, "In Bukhari and Muslim, it is
								confirmed that the Messenger of Allah k said in the Hadith about al-Isra, after
								ascending to
								the seventh heaven: 'Then, was taken to al-Bayt al-Ma'mur. It is visited every day by
								seventy thousand angels who will not come back to visit it again.'</p>

							<p>The angels worship Allah in Al-Bayt Al-Ma'mur and perform Tawaf around it just as the

								upon him) said:<b>"One hundred and twenty mercies descend upon the Ka'bah every day and
									night; sixty for those performing tawaf, forty for those engaged in salah and twenty
									for
									those who are merely looking at the Ka'bah."</b>(Bayhaqi)</p>
							<h6 class="mt-4">Purpose of Tawaf:</h6>
							<p class="mt-2">Tawaf is an essential part of Umrah or Hajj (Rukn), also it shows the unity
								of
								Allah's believers and servants from different parts of the world who came to His house
								to
								worship. They all worship their one Lord in unity, harmony by walking in rounds

							<h6>Purification For Sa'i</h6>
							<p class="pdt-20">Most scholars are of the opinion that purification is not necessary for
								performing Sa'i between Safa and Marwah in light of what the Prophet ( peace and

								be upon him said to 'Aishah once when she menstruated. He (peace and blessings be upon
								him)
								told her, "You may perform all rites (of Hajj) as other pilgrims do, except performing
								Tawaf
								around the Ka'bah which you may do after you are clean and no longer menstruating."
								(Muslim)
								'Aishah and Umm Salamah said, "A woman who performs the Tawaf, offers a two rak'ah
								prayer
								(by the Station of Ibrahim), and then finds that her period has started, may perform
								Sa'i
								between Safa and Marwah." (Reported by Sa'id bin Mansur) It is preferable, however, to
								be in

							<p class="pdt-30">The reason behind the name "Yawmu Al-Tarwiyah</p>
							<p class="pdt-30">A.It is the day when pilgrims take water with them to Mina (Pilgrims used
								to
								carry water with them to Mina back in the day for themselves and their camels since Mina
								has
								no water sources) and would save the water to use during the remaining days of Hajj
								(Mina +
								Arafa + Muzdalifa).</p>
							<p class="pdt-30">B.It was also said that it was called that because Ibrahim (peace and
								blessings be upon him)</p>
							<p class="pdt-20">saw a dream that night where he was commanded to slaughter his son.He
								began to
								contemplate whether this was just a dream or a message from Allah. Hence, it is a day of

							<p class="pdt-20">Jamrahtu Al-Aqabah, which is also called Al-Jamrah AlKubrah. Jamarah means

								There are three Jamarat pillars, the Jamarhtu Al-Aqabah (the closest to Makkah), then
								the
								Jamrahtu Al-Wusta (the center one) and the Jamrahtu Al-Sughra (the furtherst from
								Makkah).
								The valley narrows as it approaches Makkah which arises as an obstacle for pilgrims and
								they
								can only throw pebbles from one of its sides since the other side is blocked by a
								mountain.
								Lately, with the renovations and construction in Mina, the mountain has been removed to

							<p>Ibn-Abaas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the prophet ( peace and blessings

								devil appeared to Ibrahim around Jamrahtu Al-Aqabah in order to test and distract him
								from
								the obedience of Allah. The Angel Gabriel threw 7 pebbles (one by one) on the devil, and
								instructed prophet Ibrahim to do so, then the devil disappeared. And this story is

								<br> Sheikh Al-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) commented in his Tafseer book,

							<p>But, for us it symbolizes the devil as an enemy you must reject and not allow in your

								"Therefore, the wisdom behind throwing the pebbles is obedience to Allah's commands as
								his
								loyal slave without questioning His command."
								<br>In "The Revival of the Religious Sciences", Al-Ghazali (may Allah have mercy on him)
								says: "As to the throwing of the pebbles, it is an expression of the thrower's intention
								to
								obey Allah's commandment, and a demonstration of his humility and servitude to Him. It
								signifies compliance with divine commandment without any trace therein of any selfish
								pleasure, sensuous or intellectual."By throwing pebbles, one emulates Ibrahim (peace be

								doubts in his heart or tempt him and divert him away from his Lord, so Allah commanded
								Ibrahim to drive the Satan away by throwing pebbles at him.</p>

							<p class="pdt-20">For women it is desirable to perform Tawaf Al-Ifadah as early as possible
								on
								the Day of Nahr, if they fear they will begin to menstruate. 'Aishah (may Allah be
								pleased
								with her) used to order the women (pilgrims) to perform it on the Day of Nahr10th of
								Zhul-Hijjah, as a precaution against the menses.</p>
							<p>"Ata ibn Rabah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, "If a woman (pilgrim) is afraid of her
								monthly period, she may perform the Tawaf of Ifadah before throwing the pebbles at
								Jamarah
								Al-Aqabah, and even before her sacrificial animal is slaughtered.</p>
							<p>There is no harm in a woman pilgrim using any medicine to delay her periods to perform
								this
								Tawaf.</p>

								rituals mentioned above, the time has come for the concluding ritual. At this time, you
								must

								immediately before leaving Makkah.</p>
							<h6 class="pdt-20">Farewell Tawaf</h6>
							<p>This is called the Farewell Tawaf because by this a pilgrim bids farewell to Ka'bah, the
								House of Allah. In this there is no jogging (ramal), and it is the last rite performed
								by a
								nonresident pilgrim in Makkah before leaving for his home. Imam Malik (may Allah have
								mercy
